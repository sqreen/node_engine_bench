## tl;dr

Node.js is evolving right now. The recent Node.js v8 version (not to be mistaken with V8, the JavaScript engine) 
[has just been published](<!--TODO: link-->). In the meanwhile, the ChakraCore base version of Node.js is 
[in active development](https://github.com/nodejs/node-chakracore).
 
As the future of Node.js stands in JavaScript engine agnosticism, one can legitimately wonder how the different engines 
compete in term of performance.

<!--TODO: links-->
We performed a benchmark over a few versions of Node.js:
* Node.js 6.10.1 (TODO: V8 version)
* Node.js 7.10 (TODO: V8 version)
* Node.js 7.10 with the `--turbo --ignition` flags (TODO: V8 version)
* Node.js 8.0 (TODO: V8 version)
* Node.js 8.0 with the `--turbo --ignition` flags (TODO: V8 version)
* Node.js 8.0 (TODO: ChaKraCore version)

The results of this benchmark are available through a small visualization tool <!--TODO: link-->.
